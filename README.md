I have a BA in English and German, an MFA in Writing, and a PhD in English with a focus in creative writing.

I have done lots (and lots) of different things professionally, many of which are covered in the initial list above. Mostly, I've been a teacher, but I also ran a small, English-language library, worked as a projectionist in an art house cinema, wrote and acted in a play at the Neofuturarium in Chicago, and made color copies at Kinko's. I have published books and appeared in films.

This is what I look like to a robot (and if you click on the image, you can visit my (current) personal website):
